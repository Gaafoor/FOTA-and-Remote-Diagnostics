# FOTA-and-Remote-Diagnostics
Enhancing Autosar-Based Firmware Over-the-Air updates in Automotive Industry: Implementing Delta Updating and Security Levels
Our main features are: 
1. Delta Updating Using CRC
Implements an efficient firmware update mechanism by transmitting only the differences between the new and old firmware versions. Utilizes Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) to verify the integrity of the update by calculating the CRC for each 1 KB, ensuring that the firmware is correctly applied without errors or data corruption.

2. AUTOSAR Memory Stack
Integrates a robust memory management framework that is compliant with AUTOSAR standards, enabling structured and reliable data storage handling. This stack ensures that critical automotive functions have access to the necessary data, while also optimizing memory usage across various modules.

3. SPI & CAN Communication
Facilitates high-speed, reliable communication between electronic control units (ECUs) and sensors in vehicles through Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and Controller Area Network (CAN) protocols. These communication channels are essential for real-time data exchange in automotive systems, ensuring seamless operation of interconnected components.

4. Remote Diagnostics
Allows for the remote monitoring, analysis, and troubleshooting of vehicle systems, providing insights into the vehicleâ€™s health without requiring physical access. This feature enhances maintenance capabilities, reduces vehicle downtime, and helps in predicting potential failures before they occur.

5. UDS Security Access Service
Implements a secure access control mechanism through the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol. This service ensures that only authorized personnel can perform critical diagnostics and firmware updates, protecting the vehicle's systems from unauthorized interventions and potential security threats.

6. FreeRTOS
Integrates FreeRTOS, a real-time operating system designed for embedded systems, to manage the concurrent execution of tasks. FreeRTOS ensures that automotive processes are executed with precise timing, enhancing the reliability and responsiveness of the system, particularly in safety-critical applications.
